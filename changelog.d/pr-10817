synopsis: Fix PATH changes not triggering REPL reconfiguration
packages: cabal-install
prs: #10817
issues: #2015

When modifying your PATH environment variable between Cabal commands, REPL
sessions will now correctly use the updated environment. Previously, if you
changed your PATH after initial configuration, Cabal would continue using the
old PATH settings in REPL sessions without warning.

With this fix, Cabal properly detects PATH changes and reconfigures the REPL
accordingly, ensuring tools and libraries in your current PATH are available.
While this may cause additional rebuilds when PATH changes, it prevents the
confusing errors that could occur when your REPL environment didn't match your
system configuration.
