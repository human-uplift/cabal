synopsis: Fix --enable-documentation swallowing GHC options
description: >
  When using --enable-documentation alongside other GHC options like --ghc-options="-Wall -Werror",
  the -haddock flag was being prepended to the list of program arguments, and when combined using <>
  (which is left-biased), -haddock would swallow all other arguments. This issue has been fixed by
  appending -haddock to the end of the list of arguments instead.
