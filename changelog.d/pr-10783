synopsis: Fix conflict between -haddock flag and other GHC options
packages: cabal-install
significance: bugfix

description: {

When documentation was enabled, the `-haddock` flag was prepended to GHC's program
arguments, which caused it to override other GHC options like `-Wall -Werror`. This
has been fixed by appending `-haddock` at the end of the existing arguments list
instead, ensuring that other GHC options are not lost when documentation is enabled.

}
